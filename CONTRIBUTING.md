## Commit Messages

As a general rule, the style and formatting of commit messages should follow the guidelines in
[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

In addition, any commit that is related to an existing issue must reference the issue.
For example, if a commit in a pull request addresses issue \#999, it must contain the
following at the bottom of the commit message.

```
Issue: #999
```
